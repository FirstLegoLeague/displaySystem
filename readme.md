Display System can be a block in a larger framework of cooperating modules. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/FirstLegoLeague/Coordination/wiki)

However, it can also be used standalone.

## Display System

![rednblue-plus theme](themes/rednblue-plus/rednblue-plus.png)

This is a general purpose, configurable system for data display. It currently contains 8 modules, which are explained further on.

All modules can be controlled via [websockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). In particular, we support [mhub](https://github.com/poelstra/mhub), which was made for this purpose and supports a higher level of messaging, routing, relaying and clustering. In any case, ordinary websocket is supported, as long as it delivers messages in the format described in the modules.

Also, all modules can be controlled via a javascript interface, so you can write your own scripts to interface with them. Lastly, we provide a control panel that can be opened in a separate screen to control the modules.

Get it running
-------

### Test online

You can check out display system [online](https://firstlegoleague.github.io/displaySystem/), however, you can't really customize anything. It is a nice way to check it out though.

Everything is served over https, which allows the webcam to work. If you want to [control the system via websockets](#controlling-the-modules-via-websockets), you can easily set up your own [mhub](https://github.com/poelstra/mhub). See [Controlling the modules via websockets](#controlling-the-modules-via-websockets) for a description to get that running.

### Get it locally

Either:

- If you know what `git` is: clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/FirstLegoLeague/displaySystem.git` and check out the branch `gh-pages`.
- Otherwise, just download the zip from: <https://github.com/FirstLegoLeague/displaySystem/archive/gh-pages.zip> and unpack.

There are a few ways to use this package

### As a simple display in the browser

1. Double click `index.html`. This shows a white screen. Don't worry.
1. Open the console by pressing `F12` and selecting the `console` tab.
1. Type `displaySystem.modules.time.show()` and hit `enter`.

Ok, some clarification. All modules are hidden by default. Also, all modules are accessible to javascript, which makes it possible to control them. In step 3, you just executed some javascript to show the time. Let's do this some more:

- `displaySystem.modules.time.hide()`
- `displaySystem.modules.clock.show()`
- `displaySystem.modules.clock.start()`

You probably do not want to do this every time you load the display. So, open `config.js` and replace

    'clock': {
        // visible: true
    },

by

    'clock': {
        visible: true
    },

And reload the page. Voil√†, the clock is visible by default. You can also do this with other modules.

Also, you probably always want to use the page in full screen mode. To enable full screen, press `F11`.

### Using key bindings

A few key bindings are available by default, but they can be customized by adjusting the `keybindings` configuration

- `q`: show the time
- `a`: hide the time
- `w`: show the clock
- `s`: hide the clock
- `e`: show the lower third
- `d`: hide the lower third
- `r`: show the twitter bar
- `f`: hide the twitter bar
- `t`: show the list
- `g`: hide the list
- `c`: show the control window

### Using the control window

Since the display can be controlled by javascript, you could create a control window with buttons and such to control everything. You may set this up with two monitors, one facing the audience and one facing you. This way, you can control the screen without having buttons visible.

Luckily, we have already done this for you, but there is a catch. The control window does not work when you are using the display system directly from the file system (if this is the case, the address bar starts with `file:///`). There are a few ways to solve this:

- Use the [online version](https://firstlegoleague.github.io/displaySystem/), but as said, there is not much to customize here.
- Host it somewhere online (most hosting providers allow you to FTP the files).
- Host it locally, for this you need to install a web server. The easiest one I can think of is installed like this:
    - install nodejs from <https://nodejs.org/>
    - open a command window (from the start menu, type `cmd` and press enter)
    - open the folder where you downloaded this display system (in the command window)
    - type `npm install`
    - type `npm start`
    - you can now open the application by navigating to <http://localhost:1391>
- Lastly, you can also control the display system by other means, but this gets more complicated. More on that below.

So, the control window. To open it, press `c`

The control window shows buttons for all commands that the modules have. There are also input fields if the commands can take arguments. Try and use this to display the time or the clock (for instance in the [online version](https://firstlegoleague.github.io/displaySystem/)).

### Using as a video overlay system

If you want to use the display system as an overlay to a video feed (which is the original purpose), you need to get rid of the white background and replace it with live video. There are several ways to do this

- Use the browser as your video mixer. To do this, use the `camera` module. By feeding in a video signal (for instance using a usb camera), you can create a composite output. You may want to set the [background module](#background) to black if the screen size does not match the video size. If you have a webcam, you may already have discovered this in the [online version](https://firstlegoleague.github.io/displaySystem/).
- Give the background a special color, and use a separate video mixer with [chroma key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key) capabilities to mix the overlay over a video feed. Use the [background module](#background) to do this.
- Use more advanced software video mixing software, like [caspar CG](http://www.casparcg.com/). In the newest versions, you can use a `HTML producer` to overlay a webpage (like this display system) over a video. Make sure, you disable the background module to have a transparent background. Also, from within Caspar, you can create JavaScript functions to control the modules, much like we have done manually from the console.

Configuration
--------------

All basic configuration is done in the config.js file. The configuration options are:

- `wsHost`: Websocket host to connect to, if any
- `mserverNode`: Node to subscribe to when using [mhub](https://github.com/poelstra/mhub), can be omitted otherwise
- `modules`: Object of modules to load. The keys should correspond to names of js files in the modules folder, the values can be an empty object or some configuration, see the modules section for configuration options per module. The config already contains all options, but some are commented out. Enable them by removeing the comments.
- `modulePath`: Path to load the modules from, defaults to `modules`. Can even be an url to another domain, since everything is loaded as a normal JavaScript file.

Advanced usage
-----------

### Controlling the modules via websockets

If the display system is configured to listen to a websocket server, which can be [mhub](https://github.com/poelstra/mhub) or some other websocket server, it expects messages of the form:

    {
        "topic": <module:action>,
        "data": {
            arg1:value1
        }
    }

For example:

    {
        "topic": "twitter:addMessage",
        "data": {
            "id": 123,
            "user": {
                "screen_name":"FLL"
            },
            "text": "FLL is great!"
        }
    }

Since websockets only support text transfer, the above object should be serialized to JSON. It is automatically deserialized and passed to the apropriate module. To get mhub-server running, just read [the instructions](https://github.com/poelstra/mhub). In short:

Install:

    npm install -g mhub

Configure `sever.conf.json`:

    {
        "listen": {
            "port": 13900
        },
        "verbose": true,
        "nodes": ["default", "test", "overlay", "twitter"],
        "bindings": [
            { "from": "twitter", "to": "overlay", "pattern": "*" }
        ]
    }

Start:

    mhub-server

Send a message:

    //*nix
    mhub-client -n default -t twitter:addMessage -d '{"id":123,"user":{"screen_name":"FLL"},"text":"FLL is great"}'
    //windows
    mhub-client -n default -t twitter:addMessage -d "{""id"":123,""user"":{""screen_name"":""FLL""},""text"":""FLL is great""}"

In your `config.js`, make sure you have the following options:

    wsHost: "localhost:13900",
    mserverNode: "overlay"

Note that in the mhub-server config (`server.conf.json`), the `twitter` node is forwarded to the `overlay` node. That makes this setup work.

For the online version, mhub-server needs to run with tls enabled. To do this, add certificate files to `server.conf.json`:

    {
        "listen": {
            "port": 13900,
            "key": "../certs/privkey.pem",
            "cert": "../certs/fullchain.pem"
        },
        "verbose": true,
        "nodes": ["default", "test", "overlay", "twitter"],
        "bindings": [
            { "from": "twitter", "to": "overlay", "pattern": "*" }
        ]
    }

These files are created by the great folks at [daplie](https://github.com/Daplie/localhost.daplie.com-certificates), who provide certificates for the `localhost.daplie.com` domain, which just points to localhost (127.0.0.1). The files you need are these:

- [privkey.pem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daplie/localhost.daplie.com-certificates/master/privkey.pem)
- [fullchain.pem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daplie/localhost.daplie.com-certificates/master/fullchain.pem)

Note that in the default (online) `config.js`, we have:

    wsHost: "wss://localhost.daplie.com:13900",
    mserverNode: "default"

All api functions are automatically exposed as mhub topics. For example, where we used `displaySystem.modules.clock.show()` via the command line before, we can now do the same via websockets:

    mhub-client -n default -t clock:show

When data needs to be added, for example when arming the clock via `displaySystem.modules.clock.arm(30)`, we need to add a data segment to the `mhub-client` message:

    mhub-client -n default -t clock:arm -d '{"countdown":30}'

### Adding a twitter feed to your display

Being able to send messages via websockets is nice, but it would be even more nice to connect a twitter feed to the whole lot, right? Luckily there is a command line application to read a twitter stream: [node-tweet-cli](https://github.com/voronianski/node-tweet-cli)

Install it like so:

    npm install -g node-tweet-cli

Login (see [the instructions](https://github.com/voronianski/node-tweet-cli) if it is not clear):

    tweet login

Now test your twitter stream in the console:

    tweet stream lego

This would start streaming live twitter messages in your console. You are now one step away from connecting everything:

    tweet stream lego --json | mhub-client -n default -t twitter:addMessage -i json

This command uses [pipes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) to take the output of the `tweet` utility and *pipe* it into `mhub-client`.

**By the way...** the hosted version listens to `localhost:13900/` on the `default` node. So you can set up `node-tweet-cli` and `mhub-server` locally and still use the hosted version of the display system. Isn't that sweet?

### Controlling time

If you have a number of displays, all showing the time, you may want to be sure every display is showing the correct time. By default, the `time` module shows the system time, but that may be different (if not configured properly) between systems.

Also, you may want to set another time altogether, for example number of minutes into a match.

To set the time, you could just use the control window, but you can also use the websockets interface.

A nice way to ensure a consistent time is to just *pipe* a timestamp into `mhub-client`.

First install the [cli-time utility](https://github.com/FirstLegoLeague/cli-time):

    npm install -g cli-time

Then make sure that in the mhub-server config (`server.conf.json`), the `time` node is forwarded to the `overlay` node.

Then pipe it through to an mhub-client instance:

    cli-time -m json -i | mhub-client -n default -t time:set -i json

To set the time to 0 and start counting:

    //*nix
    mhub-client -n default -t time:set -d '{"timestamp":"0"}'
    //windows
    mhub-client -n default -t time:set -d "{""timestamp"":""0""}"

Note that the `"0"` is quoted and it actually means setting the time to Jan 1 2000 at 00:00 in your local timezone.

Modules
------------

This bit lists the available configuration options for the modules (that you can use in `config.js`). Also, it lists the available javascript functions you can call. Use the following code in the console (behind `F12`):

    displaySystem.modules.<module>.<function>()

For example:

    displaySystem.modules.time.show()

### background

Background color of the application. Can be used for chromakeying. If not used, the background color is not defined, which can mean transparent in for instance a [casparCG HTML producer](http://www.casparcg.com/)

Configuration options:

- `visible`: initial visibility, defaults to true
- `color`: color of the background, can be any css color, which includes names, rgb, rgba and hex colors.

Exposed api:

- `show()`: show the background
- `hide()`: hide the background, which can mean transparent in some applications
- `set(color)`: sets the background to the specified color
- `clear()`: clear the background by setting it to transparent

mhub topics:

### gallery

A gallery of images. Partially transparent images may be used to display for example some logos in corners of the screen. Note that in addition to displaying images, you can use a custom css stylesheet to completely customize your experience (this is somewhat of a more advanced usage though).

To store images online, use any image hosting service, like [imgur](http://imgur.com/), [postimage](https://postimage.io) or [tinypic](http://tinypic.com/)


Another option for gallery is to display arbitrary pages. These will be displayed in an `iframe`. Note that not all websites can be displayed this way. Some of them do not allow rendering in an iframe.

Configuration options:

- `visible`: initial visibility, defaults to false,
- `timeout`: time between transitions, in seconds. Enter 0 to disable transitions.
- `transition`: method of transition. Currently `fade` is the only option, it is also the default.
- `size`: sizing method to display the image, can should be a valid [css3 `background-size`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size) property. In practice: one of the following:
    - `cover`: enlarge the image to cover the screen, some parts may be cropped
    - `contain`: enlarge the image to fit the screen, there may be empty space around the image
    - `100% 100%`: stretch the image to fit the screen, it may become distorted
    - `auto`: display the image as is
- `images`: array of image urls
- `pages`: array of urls

Exposed api:

- `show()`: show the gallery
- `hide()`: hide the gallery
- `prev()`: transition to previous image
- `next()`: transition to next image

- `load(images)`: loads the given images, either as an array of strings or a single string of newline separated urls
- `pages(pages)`: loads the given pages, either as an array of strings or a single string of newline separated urls

mhub topics:

- `gallery:show`
- `gallery:hide`
- `gallery:prev`
- `gallery:next`
- `gallery:set` data: `{"index":<number>}`
- `gallery:load` data: `{"images":[<string>]}`
- `gallery:pages` data: `{"pages":[<string>]}`

### sprite

Simple individual images or bits of text that can be placed anywhere on the screen. This is useful for displaying watermarks or logos.

To store images online, use any image hosting service, like [imgur](http://imgur.com/), [postimage](https://postimage.io) or [tinypic](http://tinypic.com/)

Configuration options:

- `visible`: initial visibility, defaults to false,
- `sprites`: an array of objects, containing
    - `html` (optional): html content of the sprite. This can be text or more elaborate content
    - `<cssProps>`: any css property to set. For example `left` or `top`. Note that the property names should be camelCased, like `marginLeft`

Exposed api:

- `show()`: show all sprites
- `hide()`: hide all sprites
- `showSprite(index)`: show a particular sprite
- `hideSprite(index)`: hide a particular sprite

mhub topics:

- `gallery:show`
- `gallery:hide`
- `gallery:showSprite` data: `{"index":<number>}`
- `gallery:hideSprite` data: `{"index":<number>}`

### clock

A simple countdown clock. This is the same clock as available on <https://github.com/FirstLegoLeague/clock>

Configuration options:

- `visible`: initial visibility, defaults to false
- `countdown`: initial time in seconds

Exposed api:

- `show()`: show the clock
- `hide()`: hide the clock
- `arm(countdown)`: arm the clock. By default it arms to 2:30 minutes. You can arm to a different time by passing in seconds. Hence `arm(10)` arms the clock to 10 seconds
- `start(countdown,startTime)`: `countdown` is seconds to countdown from, without data uses previous set arm time
- `stop()`: stops the clock, and leave it at the countdown time
- `pause()`: pauses the clock when running, and resumes it when paused (toggle)

mhub topics:

- `clock:show`
- `clock:hide`
- `clock:arm` data: `{countdown:<sec>}`
- `clock:start` data: `{countdown:<sec>,startTime:<timestamp>}`
- `clock:stop`
- `clock:pause`

### time

Shows the current system time. Or some other time if you wish

Configuration options:

- `visible`: initial visibility, defaults to false

Exposed api:

- `show()`: show the time
- `hide()`: hide the time
- `set(timestamp)`: sets the time (and ticks along). Pass in a unix timestamp. Eg `set('2015-02-07T13:00')` or `set(1423314000000)`
    - `set()`: passing nothing sets the time (back) to the system time
    - `set('0')`: passing `0` sets the clock to zero (it actually sets the clock to Jan 1 2000 at 00:00 in your local timezone)
- `format(mask)`: a formatting string to display the time, defaults to `HH:MM`

The time formatting if based on Steven Levithan's excellent [dateFormat()](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/date-time-format) function. For possible mask configuration, see [his blog article](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/date-time-format)

mhub topics:

- `time:show`
- `time:hide`
- `time:set` set the current time, data should be of the form:

        {
            "timestamp": "2015-05-14T15:48:54+0200"
        }

    This is just an iso formatted time string, the standard output of [cli-time](https://github.com/FirstLegoLeague/cli-time)

Configuration options:

- `href`: url to a stylesheet, can be local, or hosted somewhere. It can also be an array of stylesheets, which is used for theme modifiers.
- `gist`: gist id to load alongside the stylesheet, can be used to customize themes

Exposed api:

- `set`: set the stylesheet, passing in the `href` parameter
- `gist`: load a stylesheet from a gist id. All css files are concatenated and used as data url
- `reset`: resets the stylesheet back to the `config.js` option

### geometry

This module controls screen geometry. It allows you to rotate the display, control overscan parameters and zoom.

Configuration options:

- `zoom`: zoom level of the window
- `aspect`: either the string "native" or the aspect ratio of the device used. This can be used to compensate for aspect ratio problems
- `rotation`: rotation of the display in degrees

### keybindings

This is a module that handles key bindings. By default it can show and hide other modules and show the control window, as explained in the [Using key bindings](#using-key-bindings) section above. However, this module is completely user configurable.

The module uses [David Flanagan's keymap.js](https://github.com/luics/Luy.Web/blob/master/!reading-note/!javascript-the-definitive-guide/17/Keymap.js), which is kept in a repository by [È¨ºÈÅì (luics)](https://github.com/luics)

The keybinding configuration takes a map of key bindings with handlers. The key bindings should be strings in the form:

    alt-ctrl-f
    v
    shift-f3

That is:

- a key like "A", "7", "F2", "PageUp", * "Left", "Delete", "/", "~"
- some optional prefixes like "alt-", "ctrl-", "shift-". These shoulde appear in **alphabethical order**

The handlers could be strings, in which case they are prefixed by `displaySystem.modules.`. This causes a string like `clock.show()` to be correctly executed. This allows for a simple way to bind module functions to keys.

Alternatively, handlers could be functions,. In that case, you can do pretty much anything you want, for example define "display groups" under numeric keys, to toggle the visibility of a set of modules.

### macro

This module lets you use the other modules exposed functions. It also includes a wait function. Each macro is a list of actions that are executed consecutatively.

Each macro is exposed as a function for this module. Therefor you get buttons for these in the console and you can use macros inside of other macros!

This is a powerfull tool to set scenes or animate sprites together.

### controls

This is the actual control window (which you must have seen by now). Display Systems comes with a standard control window that just creates buttons for all api functions of all loaded modules. You can change this by specifying a custom url to open.

Configuration options:

- `url` url to load

Exposed api

- `open()` opens the controls in a popup window

Theming
-----------

Themes can be used by pointing the `css` module configuration to a stylesheet. This stylesheet can be hosted anywhere. In particular, the following are available:

### Included themes

- `themes/rednblue/rednblue.css`: a simple red and blue theme with slanted edges
- `themes/rednblue-plus/rednblue-plus.css`: an extra fancy red and blue theme

For screenshots, see the `themes` [folder](themes)

### External themes

We will provide a yearly theme especially for the FIRST LEGO League. Currently, there is none.

### Your own themes

You can add your own themes in two ways:

1. Host them somewhere yourself, by setting up a server, or hosting it through a `gh-pages` branch in github (which we do for our themes).
2. Create a [GitHub "Gist"](https://gist.github.com/). Add as many css files as you like, then copy the last bit of the url (the Gist id) and paste it into the `gist` field in the css module.

The second method creates a stylesheet that can be used to override a certain theme or make small adjustments to it.

Extensibility
-------------

You can write your own modules. The displaySystem API provides the following methods:

- config(configuration)
- registerModule(definition)

The registerModule method expects a definition object with the following keys:

- `name`: Name to register the module under. If omitted, the module is not registered and cannot be accessed programatically
- `template`: HTML to insert in the page. This should be a JS string.
- `style`: CSS to insert in the page. This should be a JS string. Note that the CSS is inserted at the front of the head. So any custom CSS in the head will override module defaults.
- `factory`: JS to execute when the module is loaded. If the factory returns something, it is registered under the module's name and can be accessed via `displaySystem.modules.<name>`. The factory receives the configuration defined in `config.js`.

For string input, you can use [multiline](https://github.com/sindresorhus/multiline) which is included for convenience
